                <strong><em>Pepoy's Cafe and Restaurant</em></strong>
                serves a variety of dishes from the filipino cuture.
                However, they also offer western dishes and other Asian
                cuisines. My personal favorite are their fried rice.

                mostly serves light snacks and drinks like smoothies and coffee. I personally
                have never gone to the establishment itself but I have tried their promotional
                drinks which tasted amazing. Not to mention that my... <em>horizontally challenged</em>

                <strong><em>J's Bowling and Restaurant</em></strong>
                sadly closed down their bowling alley, so despite it's real name, it's more
                fitting to just call it <em>J's Restaurant</em>. However despite that,
                they know how to make some good chicken. Apart from that, they're mostly
                an all-rounder choice since they can serve various kinds of dishes.

                    let's talk about the food. I ordered the Chamoru sausage with fried

                    at a diner feel place, just like this..and the food was so scrumptiousâ€¦ 
                    I ate it all up!! Staff was friendly and made sure waters were refilledâ€¦ 
                    also food was piping hot which I can enjoy, thank you for the freskuness! 
                    I just want to say don't come here expecting it to be top tier diner, 
                    super elegant exterior, like leave that BS at the door and enjoy the humble 
                    food. The place really gives the back in the day local diner vibe and I am

                <strong><em>CK Smokehouse and Salad</em></strong>
                is another one of those all-rounder restaurant that can offer a
                little bit of everything, though much more heavily focused on Asian 
                dishes such as Filipino or Chinese. One particular thing that I 
                personally liked here was their oriental-style chicken, which tasted
                like duck.

                    <em>We stopped in for lunch after church on Sunday. Google Maps doesn't have 
                    the right location so it was hard to find. Everything we ordered, we really 
                    liked! Our server was super friendly and had great recommendations for us. 
                    We basically just ordered everything she told us to! The fried chicken was 
                    amazing! I wish I could remember the names of the other dishes, because they 
                    were all great and we would order them all again! We ordered one of the fried 
                    chickens with Wasabi and it was not super hot. My boys all thought it was 
                    delicious. The regular order of fried chicken came with a very generous amount                         of chicken! The noodle dish we ordered was probably my favorite, it was so 
                    flavorful! We'll def be back!</em><br>

                    but there's nothing wrong with that. Da chicken and pork dish was splendid as it tender, 
                    smoking hot (pun intended), and tasty. Great ginger and green onions to complement the 
                    meal as well. Quite a unique dish with the sisig omelette. It was interesting yet fun to 
                    try out. The egg itself was okay, but the sisig was hot and delicious. Nice little macaroni 
                    salad that comes with it too. Overall, CK Smoke House was pretty good, and I'd definitely come 
                    again. Whenever that happens.</em><br>

                primarily serves coffee (go figure), along with some desserts to go with it.
                However if caffeine isn't exactly your palate, they still offer some other
